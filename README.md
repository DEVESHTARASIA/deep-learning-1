# Deep Learning : You can do it !!! at Holberton School

Yes, you can do it!
Deep Learning is easy and we'll prove it!

## Introduction

The goals of these exercices are
- to disover the maths foundations of deep learning and train your first Neural Networks based on the Javascript
implementation of Neural networks by Andrej Karpathy : "ConvNetJS".
- to understand the basics of deep neural networks and play with Keras, a minimalist, highly modular neural networks
library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano.
- to develop your intuition about Neural Network and observe how their structure and hyper-paramaters impact the learning curve.
